Bob: Alright, team, let's get started. We've been assigned this new project, codename "Easy Meeting" and it needs to be built using AWS services. 
Since Chris couldn't make it, I'll send out a summary of the call later today.

Gillian: Cool - what are the requirements?

Babu: The project needs to have a central data warehouse for analytics, and a way to capture streaming data to load into this data warehouse.  The  architecture must be very scaleable, secure, and low latency. 

Bob: I'm thinking Amazon redshift should be our datawarehouse. 
And I think there's a Kinesis service for loading streaming data into Redshift. 

OK Assistant, can you tell me about using Kinesis to load Redshift?

Assistant: blah blah

Bob: Assistant thinks we should investigate <see previous answer>!  
I've worked with Kinesis before, but I'm not too familiar with Firehose. 

Gillian, have you used any of these services?

Gillian: I've played around with Kinesis a bit, but I'll need to do some more research to understand how it can be used for this project. I'm not familiar with Kinesis Firehose though.. Is anyone else familiar with it? What is it?

Bob: (trys the Ask Assistant button) or type -> what is Kinesis Firehose?

All: no, not really..

Bob: Actually I do have some information.. <read from assistant>

Bob: OK Assistant, any recommendations on where we should start?

Assistant: <stuff>

Bob: Okay, so it sounds like we all have some homework to do. 

<click SUMMARY button>

Babu: Yes, I'd love to investigate Redshift.. Let me do that by next week.

Bob: Great! Thanks Babu. 
Gillian, can you experiment with Kinesis and see how we can ingest streaming data?  
I'll look into DynamoDB. 
Let's plan to regroup next Friday with Chris and Kishore to discuss our findings.

Gillian: Sounds good, I'll have a Kinesis prototype ready by next Friday.

Bob: And I'll read up on DynamoDB and do some experiments before Friday as well.

Babu: Sounds good Bob. Exciting! 

Bob: Yep.. I'll summarize the call and action items, and send an email to the team in the next 10 minutes.
See ya. 

Babu: See ya.
Gillian: See you later.
